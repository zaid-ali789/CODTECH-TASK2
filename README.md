## **Overview of the Project**

The **Temperature Converter** is a C++ console-based application designed to convert temperatures between three common scales: **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Kelvin**. The project demonstrates the use of modular functions, user input handling, and precise mathematical conversions.

---

## **Objectives**
- To create a simple and accurate temperature conversion tool.  
- To demonstrate proficiency in C++ programming techniques, including:
  - Modular function design.
  - Handling user input and output efficiently.
  - Implementing mathematical formulas for real-world applications.  

---

## **Key Activities**
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Identified the temperature scales to support: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.  
   - Designed a simple command-line user interface.  

2. **Design and Implementation**:
   - Created modular functions for all conversion types.  
   - Implemented input validation to handle incorrect or invalid user entries.  

3. **Testing**:
   - Validated conversions with various test cases for accuracy.  
   - Tested edge cases, including extreme temperature values.
